# dummy-shells

Dummy versions of shelljs for testing.

- `dummyShellJs`: Commands do nothing. Can query dummyShellJs.execList for calls to shelljs.exec, etc.
- `dryRunShellJs`: Exec and other commands will print to console.
- `failingShellJs`: Exec and other commands will return 1 for failure.
